# Palmyra--XR-Project
I use Mixed Reality and HoloLens Technology to make the monuments of the site of Palmyra  in Syria a taingble expirience

Unity version: 2019.4.9f1 LTS
Mixed Reality Toolkit 2.4 
Compatible HoloLens 1 & HoloLens 2

You should have Blender beforehand. In the Unity project the Arch of Triumph is a Blender file. Blender is needed to view the object
